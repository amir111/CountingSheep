## Goal
The purpose of this project is to make a hotel management system that allows both front and back end users to access and use the system.  Since this is an application that will allow users to book hotel rooms, it will need friendly and easy to navigate GUI so that booking a room, requesting services and other accommodations is not an issue.  The application will also support back end needs to employees whom follow up on their customerâ€™s requests in order to make sure that all necessities are in place and issues are taken care of, as a key feature of this application allows users to directly make requests to the employees of the hotel they are staying in.  All of this will be achieved by having a good application that is easy to use on both front and back ends, will allow easy modification, an up to date database that will make sure that there are no miscommunication anywhere in the application.
